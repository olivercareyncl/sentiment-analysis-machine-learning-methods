# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis** using machine learning models to classify **IMDb movie reviews** as positive or negative. The analysis compares the performance of four models: **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. Key evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** are used to assess each model's performance.
